        <p>
            A good breakdancing warm-up is essential, combining cardiovascular exercises, dynamic stretching, and foundational movements. It boosts flexibility, strength, and endurance, prevents injuries, and sharpens focus. Tailoring your warm-up specifically for breakdancing enhances performance, ensuring you're physically and mentally prepared to push your limits creatively and safely.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Dynamic Stretching</h3>
                    <p>Include leg swings, arm circles, and hip circles to increase mobility in the joints.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Wrist and Ankle Circles</h3>
                    <p>Since breakdancing involves a lot of wrist and ankle use, focus on these areas to prevent sprains.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Bridge and Backbend</h3>
                    <p>Gently stretch and strengthen the back, increasing flexibility for moves that require arching.</p>
