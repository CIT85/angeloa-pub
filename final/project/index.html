                <h3>Global Warming</h3>
                <p>Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. This rise in temperature affects climate systems, leading to more extreme weather, rising sea levels, and disrupted ecosystems and habitats.</p>

                    <li>Melting Ice</li>
                    <li>Rising Sea Levels</li>

                    <summary>More about the effects of global warming</summary>
                    <p>Increased global temperatures can lead to more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. The melting of polar ice caps and glaciers contributes to rising sea levels, which can result in coastal erosion and affect marine biodiversity. Additionally, changes in temperature and weather patterns can disrupt the natural habitat of many species, leading to ecological imbalances.</p>
