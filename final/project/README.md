# My Project
## Topic
The topic I chose for my site is about environment and sustainability. Generally, I am pretty indecisive, so with the help of ChatGPT, I concluded that a site revolving around the environment and sustainability would be interesting. Moreover I want to specificlaly cover pollution, some climate change, energy efficiency, and overall sustainable living.
