            <article>
                <h3>Poor Air Quality</h3>
                <p>Poor air quality results from the release of pollutants into the atmosphere from various sources, including vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and burning of fossil fuels. It leads to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and environmental degradation.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>More about Air Quality</summary>
                    <p>Monitoring and controlling air pollution are essential for protecting human health and the environment. Measures such as emission standards, vehicle inspections, and promotion of clean energy sources help reduce air pollution levels and improve air quality in urban areas.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Plastic pollution occurs when plastic waste accumulates in the environment, especially in oceans and waterways. It poses threats to marine life, ecosystems, and human health through ingestion, entanglement, and the release of harmful chemicals into the environment.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>More about Plastic Pollution</summary>
                    <p>Addressing plastic pollution requires collective efforts to reduce plastic usage, promote recycling, and develop sustainable alternatives to single-use plastics. Policies banning plastic bags, straws, and microbeads, along with public awareness campaigns, can help mitigate plastic pollution and protect marine ecosystems.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Water pollution refers to the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and oceans by harmful substances like chemicals, sewage, and industrial waste. It affects aquatic ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health, leading to waterborne diseases and ecosystem degradation.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>More about Water Pollution</summary>
                    <p>Preventing water pollution involves implementing wastewater treatment systems, regulating industrial discharge, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices. Restoration efforts, such as wetland conservation and river cleanup projects, also play a crucial role in restoring water quality and preserving freshwater resources.</p>

            <h2>Soil Contamination</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Summary of Soil Contamination</h3>
                <p>Soil contamination occurs when hazardous substances, including heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, accumulate in the soil. It harms soil fertility, plant growth, and ecosystem health, posing risks to human health through food chain contamination and groundwater pollution.</p>
                <details>
                    <summary>More about Soil Contamination</summary>
                    <p>Remediating soil contamination involves techniques such as soil excavation, bioremediation, and phytoremediation to remove or neutralize pollutants. Preventive measures, including proper waste disposal and land use planning, are crucial for minimizing soil contamination and protecting human health and the environment.</p>
